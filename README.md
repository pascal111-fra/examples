# examples
Here, in this repository, we will include a collection of random or various programs programmed by Lazarus FreePascal,
and I intend to show some programming skills depending on my current experience, and of course, there are advanced 
programming more than what I offer in this repository, but I'm presenting what my hand reached to according to my
current avaliable resources. I hope these programmed examples being useful to other learning programmers like me.

Some descriptions for our examples:

OOP Example 1.rar: is a small program showing building small class(object) for "coins!", and coin object has 
the ability to generate random value presenting which side the coin shows (head/tail). The program will imagine
two coins, and will print in "memo1" the values of each coin.

OOP Example 2.rar: is same like OOP Example 1.rar but with more developing in the way of 
making same tasks of OOP Example 1.rar to be more ideal.

Example 3.rar: is just small simulation for representing the action of shuffling some cards and picking 
the most above card. The inappropriate feature here is the usage of enumerated data type as a data not as
a data type.

Example 4.rar: is simulating by code the drinking action and pouring. We use veriables and increasing and 
decreasing their values and also by using "delaying" to simulate these actions, drinking and pouring. You
need "TPlaySound" component to run this project https://wiki.freepascal.org/TPlaySound

Example 5.rar: is same like Example 4.rar but with some more data processing.

Example 6.rar: is a simulating of generating playing cards with patterns and values by using advanced records instead of objects,
and making a comparison between two generated cards.
