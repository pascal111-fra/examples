# examples
Here, in this repository, we will include a collection of random or various programs programmed by Lazarus FreePascal,
and I intend to show some programming skills depending on my current experience, and of course, there are advanced 
programming more than what I offer in this repository, but I'm presenting what my hand reached to according to my
current avaliable resources. I hope these programmed examples being useful to other learning programmers like me.

Some descriptions for our examples:

OOP Example 1.rar: is a small program showing building small class(object) for "coins!", and coin object has 
the ability to generate random value presenting which side the coin shows (head/tail). The program will imagine
two coins, and will print in "memo1" the values of each coin.

OOP Example 2.rar: is same like OOP Example 1.rar but with more developing in the way of 
making same tasks of OOP Example 1.rar to be more ideal.
